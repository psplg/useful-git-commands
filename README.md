#### **Common and useful git commands:**

**1. git init [project name]**
To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new master branch.

**2. git clone**
